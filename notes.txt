useQuery('super-heroes',fetchSuperHeroes,{cacheTime:1000,staleTime:10000})
cacheTime: set the time for store the fetched data in the cache
staleTime: set the time that how long the data will be keeped as fresh (and after that if we open the component a re-fetch will be required)
//note: cacheTime triggers the isLoading but the stale time doesn't. It triggers the isFetching.
